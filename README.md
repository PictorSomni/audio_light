Ambiances for table RPG

Current project using Adafruit's Feather nRF52840 and CircuitPython.
We have an emitter which advertises color values when a button is pressed and 2 receivers which triggers neopixels and audio when they read some precise colors.
The idea is simply to lauch ambiances or weather during a tabletop RPG game to make the game more interesting and believable.

The 3D files for the receiver is available here : https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4166398
